### Constant 0(1)

- Time taken is independent of the amount of data.
- Stack push,, pop, and peek; Queue enqueue and dequeue; insert a node into a linkedlist.

### Linear 0(n)

- Time taken is directly proportional to the amount of data
- Linear search; count items in a list; Compare a pair of strings.

### Quadratic 0(n^2)

- Time take is proportional to the amount of data squared
- Bubble sort; Selection sort; insert sort; Traverse a 2D array

### Polynomial 0(n^k)

- Time is proportional to the amount of data raise to the power of the a constant.

### Logarithm 0(log n)

- Time take is proportional to the logarithm of the amount of data
- Binary search a sorted list; Search a binary tree

### Linearithmetic 0(n log n)

- Time taken is proportional to the logarithm of the amount of data, multiplied by the amount of data.
- Merge sort; Quicksort

### Exponential 0(K^n)

- Time take is proportional to a constant raised to the power of the amount of data
- N-Queens problem; Traveling salesman, passwords cracking
